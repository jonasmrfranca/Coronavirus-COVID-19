# COVID-19 MAP USING PYTHON #
This is a personal project built by Jonas Marcelo da Rosa Fran√ßa, I'm a Business System Analyst and Scrum Master with a strong enthusiasm about Data Science and Python programming. Even though I'm not a developer, I'm often challenging myself about study Data Science and build visualization approaches about topics of my interest.

Recently we have been following the news about Corona Virus (COVID-19), everyday we have news about thousands of new confirmed cases because of its fast growing contamination throughout the world. For this reason, I decided to develop this map using python and other free techonlogies to provide an interesting overviwing scenario about the countries, cities and number of people affected by the virus.

The Map provides a layer where the countries affected are highlighted and also a few layers for the cities where confirmed, deaths, recovered and existing cases were noticed. The standard visualization is using "icons", where the colors represents the amount of "Confirmed" cases and the user can select the desired amount by selecting it in the layer control.

However, it's also possible to change the visualization approach by changing in the code the "mapIcon" attribute to a 'Radius' instead of "iCon", where the icons are replaced by circle and the circle's size represents the number of "Confirmed" cases.

Last but not least, this project turned real because of the brilliant dataset provided by the Johns Hopkins University and updated daily. THANK YOU!
